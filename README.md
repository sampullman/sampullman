## Welcome! :sun_with_face:
I'm Sam, I work on [PubStudio](https://pubstud.io) and a few projects at [SamaTech](https://github.com/samatechtw). I mainly do frontend work in Typescript with Vue3/Vite these days, but also have some active NestJS and Rust/Axum projects. I'm also developed native mobile apps and firmware for electronics, though it's been a few years.

### Active Projects :clipboard:
- Open source core for [PubStudio](https://github.com/pubstudio-builder)
- Image processing job runner: [image-api](https://github.com/samatechtw/image-api)
- Typescript library for building on Flow: [onflow-ts](https://github.com/samatechtw/onflow-ts)
- [nx-vue3-vite](https://github.com/samatechtw/nx-vue3-vite) Nx plugin
